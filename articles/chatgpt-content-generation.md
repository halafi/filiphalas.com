OpenAI's GPT-3 is here and it's already transforming the ways website content is created. Let's take a look at how this can impact content heavy statically generated sites using modern frameworks like React or Svelte as well as how ChatGPT can be used for writing an article or a blog post.

## Google and AI generated content
According to the [update from Google Search Central (February, 2023)](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content) Google is focused on rewarding high-quality content, no matter how it was generated, given that Google already had to fight mass-produced human generated content in the past it makes perfect sense.

Google sees AI generated content with the primary purpose of manipulating website ranking as spam and a violation of its policy. Although it's unclear whether Google can detect AI content automatically yet, with its infinite resources at disposal we can assume AI generated content detection is coming if not already in place (at minimum a human intervention).

Proper use of AI or automation is not against Google's rules.
With that concern aside, let's look at ChatGPT's uses.

## Using ChatGPT to generate Spintax
One use case of ChatGPT is that it's able to generate spintax for you, this is extremely useful when you have a template that you use to render a large number of pages (think product details or a tourist activity).

For example, I have tried this prompt with ChatGPT:

> Give me a spintax of the following text: {Barcelona} is the best destination for your vacation. Everyone should visit once in their life.

the response I received:

> {Barcelona|The Catalan city|This Spanish gem|The cosmopolitan capital of Catalonia|The vibrant Mediterranean city} {is the ultimate|is the perfect|should be on top of your list for|should definitely be considered for} {your vacation|a memorable holiday}. {Everyone|Every traveler|All globe-trotters|Every adventurer} {should|must} {visit|experience} {at least once|at least one time|once in their lifetime}.

you are free to ask for a rewrite with more variations.

ChatGPT and similar tools can save you a lot of time if you are using spintax in your project.

## Using ChatGPT to write articles
For the sake of trying it out I have looked into how an AI generates articles using the following prompt and it's variations:

> Generate a detailed outline for a blog post about "How to use ChatGPT on content heavy statically rendered websites"
> Then write a 500 words article using the outline
> You donâ€™t have to display the outline.
> Write in a conversational style.
> Break up the article into sections. Include a title as a H1, an intro, then sections as H2s. break up the article into sections and format the headers as h2 headers and the title as h1 in markdown formatting.
> break up paragraphs into at most two sentences per paragraph.
> give it a creative title.
> make sure to focus on the best answer to the question
> make it even longer:
> the conclusion should always be at the end of the article.
> use tables and bullet points when it will help to format articles.

the problems I ran into are:

- bad understanding of the title and what the article should be about
- lot of nice to read sentences (like listening to a politician) that could be removed entirely because they don't bring any real value to the reader
- it's hard to get into the style of the article if you decide to make it your own and edit it
- ChatGPT becomess slow working on more interesting topics but is quite fast on trivial topics

Another prompt I have tried:

> Write 500 words in the style of Grant Cardone on the benefits of juggling for tech enthusiasts. The tone should be exciting and persuasive. Include two quotes in the article to back up the points. Do not use juggling more than 5 times. Mention the story about a juggler who died trying to juggle a grenade.

Again the article I got is actually quite good for this prompt which I consider an easy topic, but I faced the same issues as mentioned above when trying to generate the article I am writing now.

## Conclusion
If you are doubting whether **writing content in 2023 is still worth it** you can be assured that AI is still "pretty dumb" in terms of creating high quality content, but it can replace an inexpensive copywriter and create mediocre content.

In terms of generating spintax I can see it being quite useful and am excited about what use cases the future will bring.
